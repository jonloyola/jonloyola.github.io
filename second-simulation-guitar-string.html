    <h3>Simulating a String Being Plucked</h3>
<p><img alt="Photo" src="./distributed images/Wiggle.png"></p>
<p>Distributed systems is a topic I never got to go into in depth with.
A good introductory model that has been widely studied is the wave equation.  To 
make this interesting for me, I wanted to try to simulate a guitar string 
being plucked.  A uniform density string under tension such that gravity 
can be neglected and has negligible stiffness can be analyzed and yields the 
one-dimensional wave equation as follows:</p>
<h4><span class="math">\(\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2} = \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2}\)</span></h4>
<p>where <span class="math">\(c^2 = T/\rho_L\)</span>.  The term <span class="math">\(c\)</span> is known as the speed of propogation.
<span class="math">\(\rho_L\)</span> is called the linear density, and has units of <span class="math">\([kg/m]\)</span>.  It can also
be represented as <span class="math">\(\rho_L = \rho*A\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(\rho\)</span> is the density and <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is the
cross sectional area.</p>
<p>Whats nice about this system (or the longitudinal motion of a bar) is that it 
lends itself to a solution using separation of variables.  Two ODE's must be 
satisfied: the spacial function and the function dependent on time only.  To 
keep this brief, I'll just go over the equtions necessary for the simulation.</p>
<h3>Equations</h3>
<p>Due to orthogonality, each equation associated with a mode can be solved 
separately and combined using the mode shapes.  To solve for the mode shapes,
we need the bondary condtions.  For a guitar string, I will assume a fixed-fixed boundary
condition.  This yields a natural frequency associated with each mode as follows:</p>
<h4><span class="math">\(\omega_n = \frac{n\pi c}{L}\)</span> for <span class="math">\(n=1,2,3,...\)</span></h4>
<p>The mode shapes can be derived as:</p>
<h4><span class="math">\(Y_n = \sin(n\pi x/L)\)</span> for <span class="math">\(n=1,2,3,...\)</span></h4>
<p>The figure below shows how the modes look like.</p>
<p><img alt="Photo" src="./distributed images/ModeShapes.png"></p>
<p>When the system is excited, one can look can think of the motion as a 
combination of modes that are excited.  As you go up sequentially in moden 
number, the number of nodes with zero movement increase, and the frequencies 
associated with the modes increase as well.</p>
<p>A bond graph of how a distributed system with finite modes is shown in the
figure below.  For this particular bond graph, two arbitrary force inputs are
shown.</p>
<p><img alt="Photo" src="./distributed images/BondGraph.png"></p>
<p>Depending on how many modes are included along with the location of the force
input, the mode shape "contribution" needs to be solved for the transformers.
A lambda function (or anonymous function in Matlab) can be constructed such
that it takes in the mode number and distance x and output the appropriate 
value as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code># Mode Shapes
Y = lambda n,x: math.sin(n*math.pi*x/L)
</code></pre></div>

<p>Care needs to be taken depending on the boundary condition because the mode n
may start at zero or one.</p>
<p>The last part missing are the mass and stiffness terms associated with the
each mode.  The stiffness here is a function of the tension in the string and 
the length of the string.  The modal mass and modal stiffness is as follows:</p>
<h4><span class="math">\(m_n = \frac{nc\pi}{L}\)</span></h4>
<h4><span class="math">\(k_n = m_n\omega_n\)</span></h4>
<p>A for-loop or list comprehension can be used to create a list of the modal masses
and the modal stiffnesses once the number of finite modes are decided on.  Note
that the stiffness in the equations here are different than the negligible 
stiffness assumption made in the beginning.  The stiffness like equation used
is not a function of the string being stretched.  This stiffness like equation 
just comes out of the equations.</p>
<p>Hearing is in the range of 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz.  Therefore, depending on the string
of interest, the number of modes we desire can be calculated.  For the high E-
string, the frequency of the first mode is 329.63 Hz.  The number of modes
to keep would theoretically be around 60 modes.  However, its important to note
that different modes have different enegry content, actual movement of the string
pushes the surrounding air, heat is generated in the string, and there is some
form of damping.  Realistically, my hypothesis is that we don't need all 60 
modes to recreate the sound of a high E-string plucked.  In addition, I have
no idea how human hearing is interpreted through actual vibration inside of the ear and
interpretation of the human brain.  It may be that only a small fraction of modes
are needed.</p>
<p>The bond graph shows the equations of motion for each mode used.  For this 
particular two force input system, the equations are:</p>
<h4><span class="math">\(\dot{p}_n = -k_n q_n + F_1(t)Y_n(x1) + F_2(t)Y_n(x2)\)</span></h4>
<h4><span class="math">\(\dot{q}_n = \frac{p_n}{m_n}\)</span></h4>
<h1>Input</h1>
<p>to excite the system, either an initial conditon or a force input can be used.  For
a force input, I will use an impuse.  I designed the impulse last shorter than the 
largest frequency which is associated with the highest mode used.</p>
<h1>Output</h1>
<p>Getting sound out of a vibrating string is not straight forward.  Sound is associated
with the acceleration of the string, but its movement and the amount of air it pushes
is not very powerful.  A guitar or violin has a body that is shaken by the string,
along with the air inside the body.  </p>
<p>To simplify the analysis, we assume that the string's acceleration is the primary
transport for sound.  But its not that easy.  If we pick one specific location
on the string, we may not hear all the modes because we may be in a node.   The
sound would be emanating from every point in the string.  Then it would need to be
combined at the point of the listener.  If we just combined accelerations at different points,
we may cancel out some symmetry from the mode shapes.</p>
<p>A simple way combine the sounds in a realistic manner is to assume someone is listening
to the string from some distance away.  First pick a finite number
of points on the string, then combine it at some location away.  The sound would
need to travel at the speed of sound.  This may seem like overkill, so we'll see
if it makes a difference.  This should affect how sound adds up and whether we
get constructive or destructive interference.</p>
<h1>Simulation 1</h1>
<h2>Pure Tone</h2>
<p>The first step in building up this simulation is to simulate just the first mode
of the string.  Then, integrate this idea of the sound needing to travel some distance.</p>
<p>My assumption is the listener is one meter away from the string.  If the string starts
at position (x=0,y=0), then the listener is at position (0,1).  As you travel along the string
to the end at position (0,L), one can solve for how long it takes for sound to travel at 
varying points.</p>
<p>Here is the result for when multiple sources on the string are combined vs just
taking a single point.  I chose 20 evenly spaced points between 0 and L to combine.
The impulse happens at <span class="math">\(t=0\)</span>, but the delay is from the
speed of sound taking time to reach the listener.  For a pure tone, its nearly identicle.</p>

<p>Taking the sound to a function called display from IPython, the sound is like 
when you take a hearing test or one of the tones on a phone. Very robotic.</p>
<h1>Simulation 2</h1>
<h2>5 Mode Shapes</h2>
<p>Here I include 5 modes which reach up to a frequency of 1648 Hz.</p>
<p><img alt="Photo" src="./distributed images/Sim2.png"></p>
<p>Here we see that there is a different shape taking form.  The sound difference
is definitely there.  Its like changing which pickup on the guitar is being used.
The single point I chose is near the end of the string, comparable to like a bridge
pickup.  The sound is twangy.  But still has a robotic type of sound.</p>

<h1>Simulation 3</h1>
<h2>10 Mode Shapes</h2>
<p>With even more mode shapes, the sound is getting closer.  But still robotic.  More
overtones does have an effect on the sound.  This time i've reached a frequency of 
3296 Hz for the highest mode.  The results are shown below.</p>

<h1>Simulation 4</h1>
<h2>30 Mode Shapes</h2>
<p>The simulations are taking too long now.  When I go up in modes, the time steps
are set up to be at least 10x as small as the smallest period.   I've reached
9888 Hz.</p>
<p>Combined it does sound more and more realistic, but simulation time is getting worse.</p>

<h1>Simulation 5</h1>
<h2>30 Mode Shapes witih Damping</h2>
<p>Damping is added to the modes after the separation of variables.  This is simple
to do with bond graphs and adds a damping term <span class="math">\(R_n\)</span> to the momentum equation 
as follows:</p>
<h4><span class="math">\(\dot{p}_n = -k_n q_n - R_n \frac{p_n}{m_n} + F_1(t)Y_n(x1) + F_2(t)Y_n(x2)\)</span></h4>
<p>The damping ratio was chosen to be extremely small in order to not damp out the 
system immediately, at <span class="math">\(\zeta = 0.0005\)</span></p>
<p>This results in the following accelerations from the point of the listener:</p>
<p><img alt="Photo" src="./distributed images/Damp.png"></p>
<p><a href="./distributed audio/ThirtyModesCombinedDamped.wav">Combined</a></p>
<p><audio controls><source src="https://jonloyola.github.io/distributed%20audio/ThirtyModesCombinedDamped.wav" type="audio/wav">Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio></p>

<p><audio controls><source src="https://jonloyola.github.io/distributed%20audio/ThirtyModesSingleDamped.wav" type="audio/wav">Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio></p>
<p>A very important concept that comes out of damping distributed systems is the 
faster dissipation of the higher modes.  Since the higher modes have
much higher frequencies and thus much higher velocities, the damping forces are
relatively greater.  This can be seen when looking at the mode displacements in 
the following figures.</p>

<h1>Future Work</h1>
<p>This was an interesting project that gave lots of insight and challenges.
A way to extend the work would be to simulate using a fixed-free boundary 
condition.  At the free end attach a stiff spring which would represent the 
bridge vibrating.</p>
