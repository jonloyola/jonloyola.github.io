    <h3>Simulating Playing Harmonics</h3>
<p><img alt="Photo" src="./distributed images/ModeShapes.png"></p>
<p>This is an extension of the previous work titled 'Second Simulation: Guitar 
String'.  The idea here is to understand what happens when 'harmonics' are 
played on a guitar.  This is done by lightly holding a finger on a string at 
exact locations, plucking the string, and removing the finger.  The result is 
a higher pitched sound instead of just plucking the open string.</p>
<p>We can gather what is happening from the mode shapes.  The location of where 
to place the finger to generate harmonics is very precise: over the 12th fret (half 
the length of the string), over the 7th fret (a third of the length), and over 
the fifth fret (a fourth of the length).  If these locations are damping any 
relative motion on the string, then we expect the fundamental frequency and 
lower overtones to be muted.</p>
<p>Any harmonics removes the fundamental frequency (mode 1) since the whole length 
of the string experiences motion for the first mode (except the boundaries).<br>
When harmonics is applied halfway up the string, the second mode is allowed to 
sound since we're at a node with zero velocity.  However, folling the mode shapes 
in the figure above, the third node is expected to be muted, while the 
fourth is allowed to sound.  Any mode that has a node halfway on the string 
would continue to sound, which are modes that are multiples of two.</p>
<p>When harmoincs is applied at one third of the wayup the string, the third mode 
is allowed to sound while mode 2 and mode 1 have velocites that damp out.<br>
Any mode having a node here will sound.  It turns out modes with 
multiples of three continue to sound.  This trend continues as you go up in 
harmonics.</p>
<p>We wish to simulate this phenomenon.</p>
<h3>Modeling</h3>
<p>The same model that was developed for the previous string plucking simulation 
can be used.  However, the bond graph is adjusted to include not only damping 
for each mode shape, but damping at a particular location <span class="math">\(x_2\)</span> on the string.</p>
<p><img alt="Photo" src="./distributed images/BondGraph2.png"></p>
<p>The bond graph above shows the resistance <span class="math">\(R\)</span> which will represent a finger 
touching the string at a location <span class="math">\(x_2\)</span>. The resistance is shown as linear 
(the colon and the resistance coefficient b) but will be applied only for a 
small amount of time.  This of course makes the system nonlinear.</p>
<p>If one follows the causality on the bond graph, we find that the 
damping force is applied to each mode momentum transformed through their 
appropriate mode shape.  The velocity that passes through the damping resistance 
is dependent on a combination of each the mode shape velocities.  </p>
<h3>Equations</h3>
<p>The equations are not too different from before.  As mentioned in a previous paragraph, 
the combination of flows from each mode shape needs to be determined.  The 
equations turn out to be as follows:</p>
<h4><span class="math">\(\dot{p}_n = -k_n q_n -b_n \frac{p_n}{m_n} +  F_1(t)Y_n(x1) + F_d Y_n(x2)\)</span></h4>
<h4><span class="math">\(\dot{q}_n = \frac{p_n}{m_n}\)</span></h4>
<p>where</p>
<h3><span class="math">\(F_d = -b(\sum_{n=1}^{N} Y_n(x2) \frac{p_n}{m_n})\)</span></h3>
<h3>Simulation Optimization</h3>
<p>A problem I came across while simulating was post processing loads of data.<br>
As explained in the previous article for simulating a string, I combined the accelerations of 
multiple points on the string in a manner such that they have a time delay as 
they travel to the listener.  My initial code was as follows:</p>

<p>The problem was a for loop that iterated through each time step of 
data.  It turns out I did not need to step through each data point.  I needed 
to operate on each element of the data with either addition, multiplication, 
or division.  Using NumPy arrays, this is possible to do directly on the array 
in some omptimized manner working under the hood which results in much faster 
processing.  Therefore, converting my arrays of data from lists to NumPy arrays 
and operating on those arrays with my math operations cut down on a significant 
amount of time.</p>

<h3>Simulation 1: Harmonics at the 12th fret</h3>
<p>The simulations will use the same parameters as mentioned in a previous 
article.  The damping ratio for all the modes is <span class="math">\(\zeta=0.0005\)</span>.  The damping 
from the finger, however, is <span class="math">\(\zeta_{Harmonic} = 0.02\)</span>, chosen somewhat arbitrarily.  The damping 
coefficient is calculated based on the modal mass and modal natural frequency 
of the first mode.</p>
<p>As a base sound, the dampened string without harmonics is below.</p>
<p><a href="./distributed audio/ThirtyModesCombinedDamped.wav">No Harmonics</a></p>
<p><audio controls><source src="https://jonloyola.github.io/distributed%20audio/ThirtyModesCombinedDamped.wav" type="audio/wav">Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio></p>
<p>As mentined before, the simulation is nonlinear since the damping representing 
the finger will only be on for a short duration.  The amount of time was chosen 
arbitrarily.  For the simulations it is a time of <span class="math">\(t=0.01\)</span> seconds unless 
otherwise stated.  The results are below.</p>
<p><a href="./distributed audio/ThirtyModesHarmonicHalf.wav">Harmonics at half length</a></p>
<p><audio controls><source src="https://jonloyola.github.io/distributed%20audio/ThirtyModesHarmonicHalf.wav" type="audio/wav">Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio></p>
<p>Monitoring the modal displacements, we can see that our explanation of harmonics 
held true.  Since the damping was at the halfway point of the string, we 
expect the modes that are multiples of two to not be damped out.  Modes 2 and
4 were allowed to ring through while modes 1 and 3 both damped out right away.</p>
<p><img alt="Photo" src="./distributed images/HarmHalf1.png">
<img alt="Photo" src="./distributed images/HarmHalf2.png"></p>
<h3>Simulation 2: Harmonics at the 7th fret</h3>
<p>Here, the damping is applied at one third of the length of the string.  We can 
hear the pitch go up.</p>
<p><a href="./distributed audio/ThirtyModesHarmonicThird.wav">Harmonics at a third of the length</a></p>
<p><audio controls><source src="https://jonloyola.github.io/distributed%20audio/ThirtyModesHarmonicThird.wav" type="audio/wav">Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio></p>
<h3>Simulation 3: Harmonics at the 5th fret</h3>
<p>Finally, damping applied at one fourth of the length of the string.</p>
<p><a href="./distributed audio/ThirtyModesHarmonicFourth1.wav">Harmonics at a fourth of the length 1</a></p>
<p><audio controls><source src="https://jonloyola.github.io/distributed%20audio/ThirtyModesHarmonicFourth1.wav" type="audio/wav">Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio></p>
<p>Here, we run into some difficulties that were unexpected.  The harmonic sound 
seems to contain some of the lower modes.  The figures of the mode shapes below 
confirm the suspicion.</p>
<p><img alt="Photo" src="./distributed images/HarmHalf411.png">
<img alt="Photo" src="./distributed images/HarmHalf421.png"></p>
<p>There is a noticably thick band of oscillation in the first and third mode.<br>
This happends because either we did not have enough damping applied for the 
finger, or the damping was not left on long enough.  Since the lower modes take 
longer to damp out on their own, we notice some of the difficulies why these 
higher hamonics are hard to play.</p>
<p>The damping applied to the first mode is at a location with less relative 
velocity than the earlier harmonics, and therefore, less effective at muting 
given the same amount of damping force and time to damp.  If the lower modes are 
left oscillating, the higher modes will die out on their own faster, eventually 
leaving only the lower modes loud enough to hear.</p>
<p>Another reason higher modes are more difficult to play is that the finger is 
not a singular point applied on the string.  The tip of the finger is touching 
some non negligable length of string.  Since the nodes get closer together in 
distance as the harmonic goes up, you tend to dampen out the harmonic for the 
mode of interest.  This is not a problem in this simulation, but should be 
considered.</p>
<p>Below the amount of time the damping of the finger is applied is doubled.  This 
leads to mode 1 and mode 3 to damp out much more.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I think we squeezed out a lot of interesting ideas from such a simple model. 
Just to remind myself, this is what I started with:</p>
<h4><span class="math">\(\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2} = \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2}\)</span></h4>
<p>There is definitely much more that could be done but for now, if I am going to 
revisit distributed systems, I may move up to a 2DOF model (Timoshenko) or try 
to explore a plate.</p>
